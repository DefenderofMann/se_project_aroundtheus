# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview  

Description:
The project is focused on website that will be able to be viewed from a windows computer as well
as a mobile device. It shows the the locations that an explorer has well... explrored
i had to make it viewable within certain amount of pixel widths for both kinds of devices
as well as make it more interactive.

improvements:
I imagine that the site will be given more functionality beyond the html and css that was used.
The links on the cards will probably lead to more photos as well as more information 
about the particular locations.
